# Lung-Cancer-Classifier


🚀 Excited to Share My Latest AI Project! 🩺🤖



In the world of healthcare, early detection can be the difference between life and death. Leveraging AI to assist in diagnosing critical diseases like lung cancer can revolutionize patient outcomes and medical processes.



✨ I just completed a project where I built AI models to classify lung cancer conditions using a dataset of patient symptoms and health behaviors. I implemented two machine learning algorithms [ Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Decision Tree ] to predict whether a patient has lung cancer or not.



🔍 Key Highlights:

Data Processing: Preprocessed a dataset of labeled health records.



Model Building: Trained both SVM and Decision Tree models to categorize patients as "YES" (lung cancer) or "NO" (normal).



Evaluation: Achieved over 90% accuracy in classifying lung cancer with both models.



Visualizations: Explored feature importance, correlation heatmaps, and pairplots to understand key factors driving predictions.



💡 This project has deepened my understanding of AI's role in healthcare and the powerful insights that can come from patient data. I’m excited to keep pushing forward and exploring new intersections between AI and medicine!
